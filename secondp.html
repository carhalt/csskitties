<h1 id="hdr1">The secret cat allergy that plagued egypt</h1>
<!--I'm assuming there was no cat allergy
    but I could not think of good points -->

<p> While there is no formal evidence that any cat allergen was prevelant in ancient egypt, I think 
    it is very logical that we might come to this conclusion. 
</p>
<div>
    <h3><b>example 1: cuter cats</b></h3>
    <p>Egypt could have had so many cuter cats, there are currently 41 recorded species, that is at least 39 other cat species the egyptians could've chose from. 
        This brings me to the logical argument that the Egyptians had intense cat allergies. By complete coincidence, 
        naked cats, <i>(otherwise known as a "sphinx cat")</i> fit the health standards of Egyptians completely, Thus completely prolonging
        and exploding their population.
       Just to prove my point, I asked some of my family their top 3 cats just to make sure my opinion was valid.
    <br>
The results are not dissapointing to say the least.</p>
